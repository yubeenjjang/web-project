            <p class = "content1">I visited Malaysia in 2010, 2012, and 2014. My aunt lived there. It was hard because it was hotter than Korea when I first visited. But it was nice to have more variety of tropical fruits. I went with my grandmother and grandfather in 2010 and with my brother in 2012. In 2014, I flew by myself. Malaysia airport was so big that I had to take the subway when I got off the plane, but I was worried that I might get lost, but I met my aunt safely. It was probably the biggest challenge of my life.</p>
           

            <p class = "where2">Japan</p>
            <img class = "picture-right" src = "C:\Users\82109\OneDrive\바탕 화면\발구지\japan.jfif">
            <p class = "content2">I traveled to Japan with my mom for 2 nights and 3 days in May 2018. I went to Universal Studios and my mom had a hard time riding the scary roller coaster because of me. And Japanese convenience store food was delicious. The pudding was especially delicious.
                I want to go with my friends again later.</p>
            
            <p class = "where3"> Jeju Island</p>
            <img class = "picture-left" src = "C:\Users\82109\OneDrive\바탕 화면\발구지\jeju.jfif">
            <p class = "content3">I have been to Jeju island many times, but the most recent time I went was in the second grade of high school. It was more fun because I went with my friends. It was fun to see the sea and Dolharubang, but it was more memorable to watch a movie after ordering chicken in the evening. And I went to Jeju Island in the fall, and I think it would be better to go in the summer.</p>


            <p class = "where4">Busan</p>
            <img class = "picture-right" src = "C:\Users\82109\OneDrive\바탕 화면\발구지\busan.jfif">
            <p class = "content4">I went on a trip with my friends for the first time as an adult. And it is my first visit to Busan. I took a plane for the first time in a long time, so I went around a lot of Busan restaurants and enjoyed the sea. Curiously, the sea didn't smell fishy. So it was better and more fun because I was with my friends.</p>

            <p class = "last">I want to travel all the time</p>
